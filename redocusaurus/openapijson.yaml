  description: >

    With Feldera, users create data pipelines out of SQL programs.

    A SQL program comprises tables and views, and includes as well the
    definition of

    input and output connectors for each respectively. A connector defines a
    data

    source or data sink to feed input data into tables or receive output data

    computed by the views respectively.


    ## Pipeline


    The API is centered around the **pipeline**, which most importantly consists

    out of the SQL program, but also has accompanying metadata and configuration
    parameters

    (e.g., compilation profile, number of workers, etc.).


    * A pipeline is identified and referred to by its user-provided unique name.

    * The pipeline program is asynchronously compiled when the pipeline is first
    created or
      when its program is subsequently updated.
    * Pipeline deployment start is only able to proceed to provisioning once the
    program is successfully
      compiled.
    * A pipeline cannot be updated while it is deployed.


    ## Concurrency


    Each pipeline has a version, which is incremented each time its core fields
    are updated.

    The version is monotonically increasing. There is additionally a program
    version which covers

    only the program-related core fields, and is used by the compiler to discern
    when to recompile.


    ## Client request handling


    ### Request outcome expectations


    The outcome of a request is that it either fails (e.g., DNS lookup failed)
    without any response

    (no status code nor body), or it succeeds and gets back a response status
    code and body.


    In case of a response, usually it is the Feldera endpoint that generated it:

    - If it is success (2xx), it will return whichever body belongs to the
    success response.

    - Otherwise, if it is an error (4xx, 5xx), it will return a Feldera error
    response JSON body
      which will have an application-level `error_code`.

    However, there are two notable exceptions when the response is not generated
    by the Feldera

    endpoint:

    - If the HTTP server, to which the endpoint belongs, encountered an issue,
    it might return
      4xx (e.g., for an unknown endpoint) or 5xx error codes by itself (e.g., when it is initializing).
    - If the Feldera API server is behind a (reverse) proxy, the proxy can
    return error codes by itself,
      for example BAD GATEWAY (502) or GATEWAY TIMEOUT (504).

    As such, it is not guaranteed that the (4xx, 5xx) will have a Feldera error
    response JSON body

    in these latter cases.


    ### Error handling and retrying


    The error type returned by the client should distinguish between the error
    responses generated

    by Feldera endpoints themselves (which have a Feldera error response body)
    and those that are

    generated by other sources.


    In order for a client operation (e.g., `pipeline.resume()`) to be robust
    (i.e., not fail due to

    a single HTTP request not succeeding) the client should use a retry
    mechanism if the operation

    is idempotent. The retry mechanism must however have a time limit, after
    which it times out.

    This guarantees that the client operation is eventually responsive, which
    enables the script

    it is a part of to not hang indefinitely on Feldera operations and instead
    be able to decide

    by itself whether and how to proceed. If no response is returned, the
    mechanism should generally

    retry. When a response is returned, the decision whether to retry can
    generally depend on the status

    code: especially the status codes 408, 502, 503 and 504 should be considered
    as transient errors.

    Finer grained retry decisions should be made by taking into account the
    application-level

    `error_code` if the response body was indeed a Feldera error response body.


    ## Feldera client errors (4xx)


    _Client behavior:_ clients should generally return with an error when they
    get back a 4xx status

    code, as it usually means the request will likely not succeed even if it is
    sent again. Certain

    requests might make use of a timed retry mechanism when the client error is
    transient without

    requiring any user intervention to overcome, for instance a transaction
    already being in progress

    leading to a temporary CONFLICT (409) error.


    - **BAD REQUEST (400)**: invalid user request (general).
      - _Example:_ the new pipeline name `example1@~` contains invalid characters.

    - **UNAUTHORIZED (401)**: the user is not authorized to issue the request.
      - _Example:_ an invalid API key is provided.

    - **NOT FOUND (404)**: a resource required to exist in order to process the
    request was not found.
      - _Example:_ a pipeline named `example` does not exist when trying to update it.

    - **CONFLICT (409)**: there is a conflict between the request and a relevant
    resource.
      - _Example:_ a pipeline named `example` already exists.
      - _Example:_ another transaction is already in process.

    ## Feldera server errors (5xx)


    - **INTERNAL SERVER ERROR (500)**: the server is unexpectedly unable to
    process the request
      (general).
      - _Example:_ unable to reach the database.
      - _Client behavior:_ immediately return with an error.

    - **NOT IMPLEMENTED (501)**: the server does not implement functionality
    required to process the
      request.
      - _Example:_ making a request to an enterprise-only endpoint in the OSS edition.
      - _Client behavior:_ immediately return with an error.

    - **SERVICE UNAVAILABLE (503)**: the server is not (yet) able to process the
    request.
      - _Example:_ pausing a pipeline which is still provisioning.
      - _Client behavior:_ depending on the type of request, client may use a timed retry mechanism.

    ## Feldera error response body


    When the Feldera API returns an HTTP error status code (4xx, 5xx), the body
    will contain the

    following JSON object:


    ```json

    {
      "message": "Human-readable explanation.",
      "error_code": "CodeSpecifyingError",
      "details": {

      }
    }

    ```


    It contains the following fields:

    - **message (string)**: human-readable explanation of the error that
    occurred and potentially
      hinting what can be done about it.
    - **error_code (string)**: application-level code about the error that
    occurred, written in CamelCase.
      For example: `UnknownPipelineName`, `DuplicateName`, `PauseWhileNotProvisioned`, ... .
    - **details (object)**: JSON object corresponding to the `error_code` with
    fields that provide
      details relevant to it. For example: if a name is unknown, a field with the unknown name in
      question.

            The `selector` parameter limits which fields are returned for a
            pipeline.

            Limiting which fields is particularly handy for instance when
            frequently

            monitoring over low bandwidth connections while being only
            interested

            in pipeline status.

        IMPORTANT: Clearing means disassociating the storage from the pipeline.

        Depending on the storage type this can include its deletion.


        It sets the storage state to `Clearing`, after which the clearing
        process is

        performed asynchronously. Progress should be monitored by polling the
        pipeline

        using the `GET` endpoints. An `/clear` cannot be cancelled.

        The pipeline ingests data as it arrives without waiting for the end of

        the request.  Successful HTTP response indicates that all data has been

        ingested successfully.


        On success, returns a completion token that can be passed to the

        '/completion_status' endpoint to check whether the pipeline has fully

        processed the data.

      description: >-
        Retrieve logs of a pipeline as a stream.


        The logs stream catches up to the extent of the internally configured
        per-pipeline

        circular logs buffer (limited to a certain byte size and number of
        lines, whichever

        is reached first). After the catch-up, new lines are pushed whenever
        they become

        available.


        It is possible for the logs stream to end prematurely due to the API
        server temporarily losing

        connection to the runner. In this case, it is needed to issue again a
        new request to this

        endpoint.


        The logs stream will end when the pipeline is deleted, or if the runner
        restarts. Note that in

        both cases the logs will be cleared.

        Start the pipeline asynchronously by updating the desired status.


        The endpoint returns immediately after setting the desired status.

        The procedure to get to the desired status is performed asynchronously.

        Progress should be monitored by polling the pipeline `GET` endpoints.


        Note the following:

        - A stopped pipeline can be started through calling
        `/start?initial=running`,

        `/start?initial=paused`, or `/start?initial=standby`.

        - If the pipeline is already (being) started (provisioned), it will
        still return success

        - It is not possible to call `/start` when the pipeline has already had
        `/stop` called and is

        in the process of suspending or stopping.

      description: >-
        Stop the pipeline asynchronously by updating the desired state.


        There are two variants:

        - `/stop?force=false` (default): the pipeline will first atomically
        checkpoint before

        deprovisioning the compute resources. When resuming, the pipeline will
        start from this

        - `/stop?force=true`: the compute resources will be immediately
        deprovisioned. When resuming,

        it will pick up the latest checkpoint made by the periodic checkpointer
        or by a prior

        `/checkpoint` call.


        The endpoint returns immediately after setting the desired state to
        `Suspended` for

        `?force=false` or `Stopped` for `?force=true`. In the former case, once
        the pipeline has

        successfully passes the `Suspending` state, the desired state will
        become `Stopped` as well.

        The procedure to get to the desired state is performed asynchronously.
        Progress should be

        monitored by polling the pipeline `GET` endpoints.


        Note the following:

        - The suspending that is done with `/stop?force=false` is not guaranteed
        to succeed:

        - If an error is returned during the suspension, the pipeline will be
        forcefully stopped with

        that error set

        - Otherwise, it will keep trying to suspend, in which case it is
        possible to cancel suspending

        by calling `/stop?force=true`

        - `/stop?force=true` cannot be cancelled: the pipeline must first reach
        `Stopped` before another

        action can be done

        - A pipeline which is in the process of suspending or stopping can only
        be forcefully stopped

        Start (resume) or pause the input connector.


        The following values of the `action` argument are accepted: `start` and
        `pause`.


        Input connectors can be in either the `Running` or `Paused` state. By
        default,

        connectors are initialized in the `Running` state when a pipeline is
        deployed.

        In this state, the connector actively fetches data from its configured
        data

        source and forwards it to the pipeline. If needed, a connector can be
        created

        in the `Paused` state by setting its

        [`paused`](https://docs.feldera.com/connectors/#generic-attributes)
        property

        to `true`. When paused, the connector remains idle until reactivated
        using the

        `start` command. Conversely, a connector in the `Running` state can be
        paused

        at any time by issuing the `pause` command.


        The current connector state can be retrieved via the

        `GET /v0/pipelines/{pipeline_name}/stats` endpoint.


        Note that only if both the pipeline *and* the connector state is
        `Running`,

        is the input connector active.

      summary: Recompile Pipeline
      description: >-
        Recompile a pipeline with the Feldera runtime version included in the

        currently installed Feldera platform.


        Use this endpoint after upgrading Feldera to rebuild pipelines that were

        compiled with older platform versions. In most cases, recompilation is
        not

        required; pipelines compiled with older versions will continue to run on
        the

        upgraded platform.


        Situations where recompilation may be necessary:

        - To benefit from the latest bug fixes and performance optimizations.

        - When backward-incompatible changes are introduced in Feldera. In this
        case,

        attempting to start a pipeline compiled with an unsupported version will

        result in an error.


        If the pipeline is already compiled with the current platform version,

        this operation is a no-op.


        Note that recompiling the pipeline with a new platform version may
        change its

        query plan. If the modified pipeline is started from an existing
        checkpoint,

        it may require bootstrapping parts of its state from scratch.  See
        Feldera

        documentation for details on the bootstrapping process.

                Name of the index that the connector is attached to.


                This property is valid for output connectors only.  It is used
                with data

                transports and formats that expect output updates in the form of
                key/value

                pairs, where the key typically represents a unique id associated
                with the

                table or view.


                To support such output formats, an output connector can be
                attached to an

                index created using the SQL CREATE INDEX statement.  An index of
                a table

                or view contains the same updates as the table or view itself,
                indexed by

                one or more key columns.


                See individual connector documentation for details on how they
                work

                with indexes.

                These labels can be used in conjunction with the `start_after`
                property

                to control the start order of connectors.

                When set, this caps how many records are taken from the
                connector’s input

                buffer and pushed through the circuit at once.


                This is typically configured lower than `max_queued_records` to
                allow the

                connector time to restart and refill its buffer while a batch is
                being

                processed.


                Not all input adapters honor this limit.


                If this is not set, the batch size is derived from
                `max_worker_batch_size`.

                endpoint

                is paused by the backpressure mechanism.


                For input endpoints, this setting bounds the number of records
                that have

                been received from the input transport but haven't yet been
                consumed by

                the circuit since the circuit, since the circuit is still busy
                processing

                previous inputs.


                For output endpoints, this setting bounds the number of records
                that have

                been produced by the circuit but not yet sent via the output
                transport endpoint

                nor stored in the output buffer (see `enable_output_buffer`).


                Note that this is not a hard bound: there can be a small delay
                between

                the backpressure mechanism is triggered and the endpoint is
                paused, during

                which more data may be queued.

                Maximum number of records processed per batch, per worker
                thread.


                When `max_batch_size` is not set, this setting is used to cap

                the number of records that can be taken from the connector’s
                input

                buffer and pushed through the circuit at once.  The effective
                batch size is computed as:

                `max_worker_batch_size × workers`.


                This provides an alternative to `max_batch_size` that
                automatically adjusts batch

                size as the number of worker threads changes to maintain
                constant amount of

                work per worker per batch.


                Defaults to 10,000 records per worker.

            When this option is set, the connector finds and opens the version
            of the table as of the

            specified point in time (based on the server time recorded in the
            transaction log, not the

            event time encoded in the data).  In `snapshot` and

            When set, the connector will stop scanning the table’s transaction

            This setting is used to limit the number of concurrent reads of the
            object store in a

            pipeline with a large number of Delta Lake connectors. When multiple
            connectors are simultaneously

            reading from the object store, this can lead to transport timeouts.


            When enabled, this setting limits the number of concurrent reads
            across all connectors.

            This is a global setting that affects all Delta Lake connectors, and
            not just the connector

            where it is specified. It should therefore be used at most once in a
            pipeline.  If multiple

            connectors specify this setting, they must all use the same value.

            Don't read unused columns from the Delta table.


            When set to `true`, this option instructs the connector to avoid
            reading

            columns from the Delta table that are not used in any view
            definitions.

            To be skipped, the columns must be either nullable or have default

            values. This can improve ingestion performance, especially for wide

            tables.


            Note: The simplest way to exclude unused columns is to omit them
            from the Feldera SQL table

            declaration. The connector never reads columns that aren't declared
            in the SQL schema.

            Additionally, the SQL compiler emits warnings for declared but
            unused columns—use these as

            a guide to optimize your schema.
        snapshot_filter:
          type: string

            Optional snapshot filter.


            This option is only valid when `mode` is set to `snapshot` or
            `snapshot_and_follow`.


            When specified, only rows that satisfy the filter condition are
            included in the

            snapshot.  The condition must be a valid SQL Boolean expression that
            can be used in

            the `where` clause of the `select * from snapshot where ...` query.


            Unlike the `filter` option, which applies to all records retrieved
            from the table, this

            filter only applies to rows in the initial snapshot of the table.

            For instance, it can be used to specify the range of event times to
            include in the snapshot,

            e.g.: `ts BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2005-01-01 00:00:00' AND TIMESTAMP
            '2010-12-31 23:59:59'`.


            This option can be used together with the `filter` option. During
            the initial snapshot,

            only rows that satisfy both `filter` and `snapshot_filter` are
            retrieved from the Delta table.

            When subsequently following changes in the the transaction log
            (`mode = snapshot_and_follow`),

            all rows that meet the `filter` condition are ingested, regardless
            of `snapshot_filter`.

        timestamp_column:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Table column that serves as an event timestamp.


            When this option is specified, and `mode` is one of `snapshot` or
            `snapshot_and_follow`,

            table rows are ingested in the timestamp order, respecting the

            [`LATENESS`](https://docs.feldera.com/sql/streaming#lateness-expressions)

            property of the column: each ingested row has a timestamp no more
            than `LATENESS`

            time units earlier than the most recent timestamp of any previously
            ingested row.

            The ingestion is performed by partitioning the table into timestamp
            ranges of width

            `LATENESS`. Each range is processed sequentially, in increasing
            timestamp order.


            # Example


            Consider a table with timestamp column of type `TIMESTAMP` and
            lateness attribute

            `INTERVAL 1 DAY`. Assuming that the oldest timestamp in the table is

            `2024-01-01T00:00:00``, the connector will fetch all records with
            timestamps

            from `2024-01-01`, then all records for `2024-01-02`, `2024-01-03`,
            etc., until all records

            in the table have been ingested.


            # Requirements


            * The timestamp column must be of a supported type: integer, `DATE`,
            or `TIMESTAMP`.

            * The timestamp column must be declared with non-zero `LATENESS`.

            * For efficient ingest, the table must be optimized for
            timestamp-based

            queries using partitioning, Z-ordering, or liquid clustering.

            When this option is set, the connector finds and opens the specified

            In `snapshot` and `snapshot_and_follow` modes, it retrieves the
            snapshot of this version of

            follows transaction log records

            **after** this version.


            Note: at most one of `version` and `datetime` options can be

        Determines how the connector breaks up its input into transactions.


        * `none` - the connector does not break up its input into transactions.

        * `snapshot` - ingest the initial snapshot of the table in one or
        several transactions. If the connector is

        configured in the `snapshot_and_follow` mode, it will ingest the
        transaction log of the table without transactions.

        * `always` - all updates generated by the connector are broken up into
        transactions, both during the initial snapshot

        and when following the transaction log.


        # How table snapshot is ingested using transactions


        If the connector is configured in the `snapshot` or
        `snapshot_and_follow` mode, and its

        `transaction_mode` is set to `snapshot` or `always`, it will ingest the
        snapshot of the

        table in one or several transactions. The exact behavior depends on the
        value of the `timestamp_column` option.

        If `timestamp_column` is not set, the connector will ingest the snapshot
        of the table in one big transaction.


        If `timestamp_column` is set, the connector will ingest the snapshot of
        the table in a series of batches, one for

        each timestamp range of width equal to the `LATENESS` attribute of the
        `timestamp_column`. Each range will be

        ingested in a separate transaction.


        See `timestamp_column` documentation for more details.


        # How transaction log is ingested using transactions


        If the connector is configured in the `follow`, `snapshot_and_follow`,
        or `cdc` mode, and its

        `transaction_mode` is set to `always`, it will ingest the transaction
        log of the table in a series of transactions,

        generating exactly one transaction for each entry in the table's
        transaction log.


        In other words, Feldera transaction boundaries will precisely match the
        transaction boundaries of the Delta Lake table.

        The default [FtConfig] (via [FtConfig::default]) disables fault
        tolerance,

        which is the configuration that one gets if [RuntimeConfig] omits fault

        tolerance configuration.


        The default value for [FtConfig::model] enables fault tolerance, as

        `Some(FtModel::default())`.  This is the configuration that one gets if

        [RuntimeConfig] includes a fault tolerance configuration but does not

        specify a particular model.

            the pipeline is running.

            If set to 0, the table will always remain empty.

            If set, the generator will produce new records until the specified
            limit is reached.


            Note that if the table has one or more primary keys that don't use
            the `increment` strategy to

            generate the key there is a potential that an update is generated
            instead of an insert. In

            this case it's possible the total number of records is less than the

            When multiple workers are used, each worker will pick a consecutive
            "chunk" of

            records to generate.


            By default, if not specified, the generator will use the formula
            `min(rate, 10_000)`

            to determine it. This works well in most situations. However, if
            you're

            running tests with lateness and many workers you can e.g., reduce
            the

            chunk size to make sure a smaller range of records is being ingested
            in parallel.


            This also controls the sizes of input batches.  If, for example,
            `rate`

            and `worker_chunk_size` are both 1000, with a single worker, the

            generator will output 1000 records once a second.  But if we reduce

            `worker_chunk_size` to 100 without changing `rate`, the generator
            will

            instead output 100 records 10 times per second.


            # Example

            Assume you generate a total of 125 records with 4 workers and a
            chunk size of 25.

            In this case, worker A will generate records 0..25, worker B will
            generate records 25..50,

            etc. A, B, C, and D will generate records in parallel. The first
            worker to finish its chunk

            will pick up the last chunk of records (100..125) to generate.

            A record is processed to completion if it has been processed by the

            all outputs derived from it have been processed by all output

            This is a count, not a step number.  If `total_completed_steps` is
            0, no

            steps have been processed to completion.  If `total_completed_steps
            >

            0`, then the last step whose input records have been processed to

            completion is `total_completed_steps - 1`. A record that was
            ingested

            when `total_initiated_steps` was `n` is fully processed when

            `total_completed_steps >= n`.

            This is a count, not a step number.  If `total_initiated_steps` is
            0, no

            steps have been initiated.  If `total_initiated_steps > 0`, then
            step

            `total_initiated_steps - 1` has been started and all steps previous
            to

            that have been completely processed by the circuit.

                This option is only valid when `mode` is set to `snapshot` or

                When specified, only rows that satisfy the filter condition are

                the `where` clause of the `select * from snapshot where ...`
                query.


                This option can be used to specify the range of event times to
                include in the snapshot,

                e.g.: `ts BETWEEN '2005-01-01 00:00:00' AND '2010-12-31

                When this option is set, the connector finds the specified

                In `snapshot` and `snapshot_and_follow` modes, it loads this

                When this option is specified, and `mode` is one of `snapshot`
                or `snapshot_and_follow`,

                table rows are ingested in the timestamp order, respecting the

                [`LATENESS`](https://docs.feldera.com/sql/streaming#lateness-expressions)

                property of the column: each ingested row has a timestamp no
                more than `LATENESS`

                time units earlier than the most recent timestamp of any
                previously ingested row.

                The ingestion is performed by partitioning the table into
                timestamp ranges of width

                `LATENESS`. Each range is processed sequentially, in increasing
                timestamp order.


                # Example


                Consider a table with timestamp column of type `TIMESTAMP` and
                lateness attribute

                `INTERVAL 1 DAY`. Assuming that the oldest timestamp in the
                table is

                `2024-01-01T00:00:00``, the connector will fetch all records
                with timestamps

                from `2024-01-01`, then all records for `2024-01-02`,
                `2024-01-03`, etc., until all records

                in the table have been ingested.


                # Requirements


                * The timestamp column must be of a supported type: integer,
                `DATE`, or `TIMESTAMP`.

                * The timestamp column must be declared with non-zero
                `LATENESS`.

                * For efficient ingest, the table must be optimized for
                timestamp-based

                queries using partitioning, Z-ordering, or liquid clustering.

        Each element in a JSON-formatted input stream specifies

        an update to one or more records in an input table.  We support

        several different ways to represent such updates.


        ### `InsertDelete`


        Each element in the input stream consists of an "insert" or "delete"

        command and a record to be inserted to or deleted from the input table.


        ```json

        {"insert": {"column1": "hello, world!", "column2": 100}}

        ```


        ### `Weighted`


        Each element in the input stream consists of a record and a weight

        which indicates how many times the row appears.


        ```json

        {"weight": 2, "data": {"column1": "hello, world!", "column2": 100}}

        ```


        Note that the line above would be equivalent to the following input in
        the `InsertDelete` format:


        ```json

        {"insert": {"column1": "hello, world!", "column2": 100}}

        {"insert": {"column1": "hello, world!", "column2": 100}}

        ```


        Similarly, negative weights are equivalent to deletions:


        ```json

        {"weight": -1, "data": {"column1": "hello, world!", "column2": 100}}

        ```


        is equivalent to in the `InsertDelete` format:


        ```json

        {"delete": {"column1": "hello, world!", "column2": 100}}

        ```


        ### `Debezium`


        Debezium CDC format.  Refer to [Debezium input connector
        documentation](https://docs.feldera.com/connectors/sources/debezium) for
        details.


        ### `Snowflake`


        Uses flat structure so that fields can get parsed directly into SQL

        columns.  Defines three metadata fields:


        * `__action` - "insert" or "delete"

        * `__stream_id` - unique 64-bit ID of the output stream (records within

        a stream are totally ordered)

        * `__seq_number` - monotonically increasing sequence number relative to

        the start of the stream.


        ```json

        {"PART":1,"VENDOR":2,"EFFECTIVE_SINCE":"2019-05-21","PRICE":"10000","__action":"insert","__stream_id":4523666124030717756,"__seq_number":1}

        ```


        ### `Raw`


        This format is suitable for insert-only streams (no deletions).

        Each element in the input stream contains a record without any

        additional envelope that gets inserted in the input table.

            Enable output buffering.


            The output buffering mechanism allows decoupling the rate at which
            the pipeline

            pushes changes to the output transport from the rate of input
            changes.


            By default, output updates produced by the pipeline are pushed
            directly to

            the output transport. Some destinations may prefer to receive
            updates in fewer

            bigger batches. For instance, when writing Parquet files, producing

            one bigger file every few minutes is usually better than creating

            small files every few milliseconds.


            To achieve such input/output decoupling, users can enable output
            buffering by

            setting the `enable_output_buffer` flag to `true`.  When buffering
            is enabled, output

            updates produced by the pipeline are consolidated in an internal
            buffer and are

            pushed to the output transport when one of several conditions is
            satisfied:


            * data has been accumulated in the buffer for more than
            `max_output_buffer_time_millis`

            milliseconds.

            * buffer size exceeds `max_output_buffer_size_records` records.


            This flag is `false` by default.

          type: integer
          description: >-
            Maximum number of updates to be kept in the output buffer.


            This parameter bounds the maximal size of the buffer.

            Note that the size of the buffer is not always equal to the

            total number of updates output by the pipeline. Updates to the

            same record can overwrite or cancel previous updates.


            By default, the buffer can grow indefinitely until one of

            the other output conditions is satisfied.


            NOTE: this configuration option requires the `enable_output_buffer`
            flag

            to be set.

                If set to a valid [tracing-subscriber] filter, this controls the
                log

                messages emitted by the pipeline process.  Otherwise, or if the
                filter

                has invalid syntax, messages at "info" severity and higher are
                written

                to the log and all others are discarded.

                The maximum number of connectors initialized in parallel during
                pipeline

                startup.


                At startup, the pipeline must initialize all of its input and
                output connectors.

                Depending on the number and types of connectors, this can take a
                long time.

                To accelerate the process, multiple connectors are initialized
                concurrently.

                This option controls the maximum number of connectors that can
                be initialized

                in parallel.


                The default is 10.

                The controller delays pushing input records to the circuit until
                at

      description: >-
        Configuration for supplying a custom pipeline StatefulSet template via a
        Kubernetes ConfigMap.


        Operators can provide a custom StatefulSet YAML that the Kubernetes
        runner will use when

        creating pipeline StatefulSets for a pipeline. The custom template must
        be stored as the

        value of a key in a ConfigMap in the same namespace as the pipeline; set
        `name` to the

        ConfigMap name and `key` to the entry that contains the template.


        Recommendations and requirements:

        - **Start from the default template and modify it as needed.** The
        default template is present

        in ConfigMap named as `<release-name>-pipeline-template`, with key
        `pipelineTemplate` in the release

        namespace and should be used as a reference.

        - The template must contain a valid Kubernetes `StatefulSet` manifest in
        YAML form. The

        runner substitutes variables in the template before parsing; therefore
        the final YAML

        must be syntactically valid.

        - The runner performs simple string substitution for the following
        placeholders. Please ensure these

        placeholders are placed at appropriate location for their semantics:

        - `{id}`: pipeline Kubernetes name (used for object names and labels)

        - `{namespace}`: Kubernetes namespace where the pipeline runs

        - `{pipeline_executor_image}`: container image used to run the pipeline
        executor

        - `{binary_ref}`: program binary reference passed as an argument

        - `{program_info_ref}`: program info reference passed as an argument

        - `{pipeline_storage_path}`: mount path for persistent pipeline storage

        - `{storage_class_name}`: storage class name to use for PVCs (if
        applicable)

        - `{deployment_id}`: UUID identifying the deployment instance

        - `{deployment_initial}`: initial desired runtime status (e.g.,
        `provisioning`)

        - `{bootstrap_policy}`: bootstrap policy value when applicable

            Warning: This setting is experimental and may change in the future.

            Requires the platform to run with the unstable feature
            `runtime_version`

            enabled. Should only be used for testing purposes, and requires

            network access.


            A runtime version can be specified in the form of a version

            or SHA taken from the `feldera/feldera` repository main branch.


            Examples: `v0.96.0` or `f4dcac0989ca0fda7d2eb93602a49d007cb3b0ae`


            A platform of version `0.x.y` may be capable of running future and
            past

            runtimes with versions `>=0.x.y` and `<=0.x.y` until breaking API
            changes happen,

            the exact bounds for each platform version are unspecified until we
            reach a

            stable version. Compatibility is only guaranteed if platform and
            runtime version

            are exact matches.


            Note that any enterprise features are currently considered to be
            part of

            the platform.


            If not set (null), the runtime version will be the same as the
            platform version.

            When this option is specified, the connector will use the provided

            authentication.  Otherwise, it will use Application Default
            Credentials (ADC) configured

            in the environment where the Feldera service is running.  See

            [Google Cloud

            When running Feldera in an environment where ADC are not configured,

            e.g., a Docker container, use this option to ship Google Cloud
            credentials from another environment.

            For example, if you use the

            command for authentication in your local development environment,
            ADC are stored in the

        ### Desired and actual status


        We use the desired state model to manage the lifecycle of a pipeline. In
        this model, the

        pipeline has two status attributes associated with it: the **desired**
        status, which represents

        what the user would like the pipeline to do, and the **current** status,
        which represents the

        actual (last observed) status of the pipeline. The pipeline runner
        service continuously monitors

        the desired status field to decide where to steer the pipeline towards.


        There are two desired statuses:

        - `Provisioned` (set by invoking `/start`)

        - `Stopped` (set by invoking `/stop?force=true`)


        The user can monitor the current status of the pipeline via the `GET
        /v0/pipelines/{name}`

        endpoint. In a typical scenario, the user first sets the desired status,
        e.g., by invoking the

        `/start` endpoint, and then polls the `GET /v0/pipelines/{name}`
        endpoint to monitor the actual

        status of the pipeline until its `deployment_resources_status` attribute
        changes to

        `Provisioned` indicating that the pipeline has been successfully
        provisioned, or `Stopped` with

        `deployment_error` being set.

            This parameter controls the execution of queries that use the
            `NOW()` function.  The output of such

            queries depends on the real-time clock and can change over time
            without any external

            inputs.  If the query uses `NOW()`, the pipeline will update the
            clock value and trigger incremental

            recomputation at most each `clock_resolution_usecs` microseconds. 
            If the query does not use

            `NOW()`, then clock value updates are suppressed and the pipeline
            ignores this setting.
